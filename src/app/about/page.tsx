          I hold a B-Tech in Computer Science and am pursuing my passion as a Full Stack Web Developer. With a focus on creating modern, efficient web solutions using the MERN stack, Iâ€™m also deeply interested in cloud computing and its potential to enhance scalability and user experiences.

          Beyond tech, I enjoy public speaking and have experience managing events, blending leadership and communication skills with my technical expertise. I'm always eager to learn, grow, and stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech landscape.
